    "  - **Importance**: Identifies variations in exertion, which may indicate periods of overtraining or recovery.\n",
    "  - **Calculation**: Calculated using a rolling window of 3 sessions with the standard deviation for each player.\n",

    "- **Baseline_Exertion & Baseline_Exertion_Deviation**: Baseline exertion per player and deviation from this baseline for each session.\n",
    "  - **Importance**: Helps measure exertion consistency and detect any significant deviations that could affect injury risk.\n",

    "- **Heart_Rate_Recovery**: Difference between max and min heart rates within a session.\n",

    "- **TRIMP_Change**: The change in Training Impulse (TRIMP) from the previous session.\n",
    "  - **Importance**: Measures changes in training load, useful for spotting sudden workload spikes.\n",

    "- **Muscle Imbalance**: A new feature created by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce multiple muscle imbalance metrics into a single component.\n",
    "  - **Importance**: Simplifies the dataset by combining muscle imbalance metrics, reducing dimensionality while preserving key variance. This can improve model performance and interpretability.\n",
    "  - **Calculation**: PCA is applied to selected muscle imbalance features (`Hamstring To Quad Ratio`, `Quad Imbalance Percent`, `Hamstring Imbalance Percent`, `Calf Imbalance Percent`, `Groin Imbalance Percent`), producing a single `Muscle_Imbalance` score.\n"
